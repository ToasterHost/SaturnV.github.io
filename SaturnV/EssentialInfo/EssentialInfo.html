	<h2>Essential Information</h2>
	
	<p> 
			The scale ratio of the model relative to the real life Saturn V rocket is 1:200, this means my model is one two hundredth of the real rocket. 
		 Saturn V rocket with all three stages stands 363 feet tall, while the model stands 21.78 inches tall. 
		 Exactly 200 times smaller than the real rocket.  The rocket was composed of three main stages, and weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds). 
		 <sup> [9] </sup>   The Saturn V rocket was the most powerful rocket ever constructed at the time. 
		 When the rocket launched, 34.5 million newtons (7.6 million pounds) of thrust were produced. 
		 The average G-forces felt during a rocket launch would be 3 g's. 
		 This is the equivalent of 3 times the normal force of gravity. <sup>[8]</sup>  
		 The first and second stages have a 33 feet diameter and the 3rd stage has diameter of 21.7 feet. 
		 The first stage is 138 feet tall, the 2nd is 81.5 feet tall while the 3rd is 58 feet tall.

		The Saturn V rocket was designed to lift 118,000 kg into orbit and 43,500 kg beyond orbit meaning it would leave 74,500 kg behind during its travel.
		 A majority of this mass is from the fuel the rocket carried. First, 770,000 litres of kerosene fuel would be burned to get the rocket out of orbit. 
		 Then, 1.2 million litres of liquid oxygen fuel was used for the second and third stages. <sup> [9] </sup>

		On the smaller side, the model has exactly one two hundredth of the dimensions that the real rocket had. 
		The second and first stages of the model have a diameter of 1.98 inches. 
		The first stage measures 8.28 inches tall while the second stage is 4.89 inches tall. 
		The third smaller stage has a diameter of 1.3 inches and stands 3.48 inches tall. 
		The Apollo Lunar Excursion Module has a diameter of 0.78 inches and is 1.32 inches tall. <sup> [9] </sup>
