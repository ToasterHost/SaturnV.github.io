		Eventually the Saturn V became obsolete. Technology advanced and better, more efficient rockets were built. 
		However, this rocket was designed by one of the most intuitive rocket designers of that time, Dr. Wernher von Braun. 
		Originally, Braun was an inventor for the Nazis. He designed the V-2 rockets, some of the most threatening weapons of world war two. 
		Braun had been fascinated by space travel ever since he was a boy, he taught himself the math and physics behind rocket travel at a young age. 
		By early 1945, Dr. Braun knew the Allies were going to win so he started planning for after the war. <sup>10 </sup>

		For fifteen after he surrendered to the Allies, he and his team of rocket engineers were taken to the United States, where they designed ballistic missiles for the American military. 
		Once 1960 hit, Braun's team was moved from the army to the newly founded NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). 
		They were tasked to design the Saturn V rocket with Wernher von Braun as the lead architect. <sup>10 </sup>

		Obviously the mission was a great success with the construction and launch of thirteen Saturn V rockets. 
		The Apollo missions put humans farther than ever before, all thanks to this German rocket engineer.

		There are many theories about the lunar landing, a large population of people believe that all the Apollo missions were faked by the United States to defeat Russia in the space race. 
		People find something they don't understand, so the only way to explain it is, the landings were faked. <sup>11 </sup> 
		However, many scientist and people have disproven these theories. Great examples of these people are the Mythbusters, who proved that many of these situations are possible outside of a movie studio. 
		Flags can move without the force of wind, shadows can go in different directions, and the moon can reflect light on to the Astronauts. <sup> [12, 13, 14] </sup>  
One of the most convincing evidence that astronauts have gone to the moon are the interviews with Neil Armstrong, you can hear the passion in his voice and he recounts the events exactly how he remembers them happening. 
 He talks about his emotions and what he remembers thinking about as he watched Earth get smaller and smaller. As you listen to him talk, you can tell that he is telling the truth.<sup>16 </sup>
