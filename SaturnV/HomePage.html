	<h2>The Long Journey to the Moon</h2>
	
	<p> 
		On July 20th, 1969, the first humans landed on the moon. Six hours later, Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon. This triumphant feat set the whole world's eyes on the stars and space exploration. This was made possible by the Saturn V rocket. This is the rocket that took all of the Apollo missions into space and it is what I decided to make a model of. 
	</p>	
<p>
	NASA spent billions of dollars, and hundreds of hours researching and perfecting the Saturn V. During this time, tensions were extremely high between two of the world's largest powers, The United States of America, and Russia. Both were trying to beat each other in what was known as the space race. Russia was in the lead since October 4, 1957 when they launched the first satellite or "Sputnik" into orbit. <sup> 1 </sup>
</p>
<p>
Russia kept a strong lead by following up with the first animal in space, first man in space, first man to orbit the earth and many more milestones. This lead terrified the United States, if the Soviets could launch satellites, then they could likely launch nuclear weapons into orbit as well. <sup>1.</sup>  America felt as though they, and democracy itself, were threatened.  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy told the country that the plan was to have a man reach the moon by the end of the decade. 1. This seemed to be a large request, but would prove that the United States was more advanced than the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
Later in the 1960's, President Kennedy would be assassinated in 1963. <sup>[2] </sup>
Martin Luther King Jr. would be assassinated in 1968 <sup>[3] </sup>
And the war in Vietnam would escalate. America had seen many tragedies so far in the 20th century, so the lunar landing was seen as a much needed positive. 600 million people watched from all over the globe on television as the three astronauts launched from earth and headed for our moon. <sup> 4 </sup>
</p>
<p>
	Some people think that the lunar landing was the United States' greatest achievement. Because within the next 50 years NASA funding would be cut, the country would fall into an unimaginable amount of debt and the "war on terror" was declared. <sup>[4]</sup> Others think that the whole operation was faked. That no one has ever gone to the moon. There are many conspiracies and theories about the Apollo missions. Many however, have been disproven. <sup>[5, 6] </sup>
	</p>
	<p>
	The lunar landing was the beginning of the "space age". I chose to make a model of what got us there, the Saturn V rocket. Science fiction had finally become reality. Although there are many people who don't believe it happened, and it was a long time ago. To me, this is one of the greatest achievements humanity has ever accomplished.
